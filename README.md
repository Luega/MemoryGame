# Lele and Bea's memory

Welcome to Lele and Bea's memory, a memory game created with Vue.js where you can choose three different levels and two types of images for the cards.

This project was created to entertain two wonderful two- and three-year-olds: Lele, a crocodile lover; Bea, who would like to have a dog. For this reason I left a little help for the resolution... can you figure out which one?
